## introduction to the course and overview of brain development in infancy and childhood

1. Download software (MRIcron and BrainVoyager EDU) 
    * MRIcron: https://www.nitrc.org/frs/?group_id=152  
    * BrainVoyager: https://www.brainvoyager.com/downloads/bv_edu_download.html 
2. Explore the regions of a brain using MRIcron (mricron.exe): 
    * Load an anatomical scan (`ch2.nii.gz`)  
    * Overlay different atlases to find MNI coordinates of: 
      * Hippocampus;
      * Inferior frontal gyrus;
      * Fusiform gyrus;
      * Uncinate fasciculus;
      * Anterior and posterior commissures;
    * Use neurosynth to identify related processes based on existing literature: https://neurosynth.org/ 
 
### test your knowledge

* What's the difference between MNI and Talairach coordinate systems?
* Try loading both `ch2.nii.gz` and `ch2bet.nii.gz`. What's the difference between these two files?
