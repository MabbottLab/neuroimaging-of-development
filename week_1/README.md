## introduction to the course and overview of brain development in infancy and childhood

1. Download software
    * MRIcron: https://www.nitrc.org/frs/?group_id=152  
    * BrainVoyager: https://www.brainvoyager.com/downloads/bv_edu_download.html 
2. Explore the regions of a brain using MRIcron (mricron.exe): 
    * Load an anatomical brain template (`ch2.nii.gz`)  
    * Overlay different atlases to find left and right MNI coordinates of: 
      * Hippocampus;
      * Inferior frontal gyrus;
      * Fusiform gyrus;
      * Uncinate fasciculus;
      * Anterior and posterior commissures;
    * Use neurosynth to identify related processes based on existing literature: https://neurosynth.org/ 
 
### test your knowledge

* What's the difference between MNI and Talairach coordinate systems?
* Try loading both `ch2.nii.gz` and `ch2bet.nii.gz`. What's the difference between these two files?
* In MRIcron, what happens when you open a file (File > Open) vs. add an overlay (Overlay > Add)?
* What's a "crosshair" in MRIcron (and other brain visualization tools)?
* What's the purpose of having many different atlases?
* What's the difference between an atlas (e.g., Brodmann atlas) and a template (e.g., MNI152 template)?
